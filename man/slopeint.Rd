\usage{
slopeint(codi, agesfit, deaths.summed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{

\item{agesfit}{a set of ages to estimate coverage from}

\item{deaths.summed}{logical. is the deaths column given as the total per age in the intercensal period (\code{TRUE}). By default we assume \code{FALSE}, i.e. that the average annual was given.}
